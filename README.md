## Why I'm Learning Node.js

Node.js is a popular, efficient, and scalable framework for building server-side applications using JavaScript. Since I'm learning full-stack development, understanding Node.js is essential for developing the backend side of web applications, including working with databases and creating REST APIs.

## Topics Covered So Far

Here’s a list of what I’ve learned so far:

- **Node.js Basics**: Setting up a Node.js environment, running scripts with Node
- **Modules**: Using built-in modules (`fs`, `path`, etc.) and creating custom modules
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Callbacks, Promises, and `async`/`await` in Node.js
- **HTTP Module**: Creating a basic HTTP server
- **File System (fs) Module**: Reading and writing files in Node.js
- **NPM (Node Package Manager)**: Installing and managing packages
- **Express.js Basics**: Setting up a simple Express server, routing, middleware
- **RESTful API Development**: Building basic REST APIs with Express

As I progress, I'll keep adding new topics here.
