What are servers used for?

Data storage and retrieval:
    One of the primary functions of a server is to store and manage data. This data can encompass everything from files and documents, to databases and media.

Web Hosting:
    Web pages are typically hosted on web servers. These servers store the websites files and deliver them to your web browser when you request a page. They handle everything from text and images to videos and interactive features.

Email services:
    They receive, store, and distribute emails to their intended recipients. Also handles spam filtering and user authentication.

Application hosting:
    Many applications are hosted on servers rather than running on individual devices. These servers provide the necessary computing power and resources to run applications like online games, productivity suites and collaborative tools.
